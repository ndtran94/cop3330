    modified recently by Chris Lacher

    This file contains the declaration of the "machine" classes SodaMachine,
    CoinCounter, and CanDispenser, as well as the "person" class ServicePerson.

    A SodaMachine object is a manager that contains one CoinCounter object and
    five CanDispenser objects (one for each brand of soda), along with the price
    of a can of soda.

A coin_counter object keeps track of money before, during, and after a
customer attempts to buy a can of soda.

A CanDispenser object keeps track of the cans of soda (of one brand)
and dispenses them on command, when it is not sold out.

A ServicePerson object is a friend of all of these classes and
reports private financial and inventory data.

NOTE: The soda machine simulation is based on ideas from "The Object
Concept" by Rick Decker and Stuart Hirshfield, PWS, Boston, 1995.
This is a fun book that we recommend for outside reading to students
after taking a first course in C or C++.
