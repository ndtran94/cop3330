   Declaration of the class user for the soda machine simulation.
   User object responsibilities are to get a legal command character
   from the keyboard, to respond to two of these (displaying the menu,
   and exiting the simulation) and return the others to the calling
   process.

   NOTE: The soda machine simulation is based on ideas from "The Object
   Concept" by Rick Decker and Stuart Hirshfield, PWS, Boston, 1995.
